Thx to Jonathan (http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) who helped a lot in making this website and by saying a lot what I mean is A LOT! Plus, the first post is actually not me but him, including the one that says making this super well-crafted website is easy. Cause tbh, I need like one sleepless night to finish this but really really enjoy it after all. Let's see what I can do here! Looking forward to seeing you again.
