Hello again I'm Mita and currently studying Informatics at Bandung Institute of Technology (reknown as ITB). I'm having my three-month-long holiday but can't stop running from deadlines still. Anyway, there are several labs that each third year ITB informatics student can register themselves, dont force me to jot them down cause I honestly forget some (apart of I'm fully aware that I'm weak at memorizing).

This year, every student can register at maximum 4 labs, mine are: RPL (Software Engineering), Basdat (Database), Gaib (Artificial Intelligence), and Sister (Distributed System). Each task may vary based on the previous lab's assistant team. This is basically quite gambling and needs a bunch of luck cause there are more or less 150 students in total and each lab only requires 4-8 people. Finger crossed!

The good news is that I will probably reduce my intensity to write irrelevant posts and start writing my project journal. Hope you enjoy it!
